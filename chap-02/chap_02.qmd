# Basic Syntax

## An example of a user-defined function

The most basic syntax to define a user-defined function
```{.cpp #lst-most-basic-syntax code-filename="function_basic_syntax.cpp" lst-cap="Most basic syntax to define a user-defined function"}
{{< include ./cpp/function_basic_syntax.cpp >}}
```

- The `function_name` is the name (identifier) of your user-defined function.
- The parentheses after the identifier tell the compiler that we’re defining a function.

## Define a function and call the function
- Of course, after defining the function, we can call it multiple times.

```{.cpp #lst-call-funcion lst-cap="Define function and call function"}
{{< include ./cpp/call_function.cpp >}}
```

## Functions can call functions that call other functions
```{.cpp #lst-function-call-function lst-cap="Function can call other functions"}
{{< include ./cpp/function_call_function.cpp >}}
```

## Nested functions are not supported
- A function whose definition is placed inside another function is a **nested function**.
- Unlike Python and MATLAB, functions cannot be nested in C++.

The following program is **not legal**:
```{.cpp #lst-nested-function lst-cap="Function can call other functions"}
{{< include ./cpp/nested_function.cpp >}}
```
# Function retrun values (value-returning functions)

## Return values
When we write a user-defined function, we get to determine whether the function will return a value back to the caller or not.

- Indicate what type of value will be returnd (**return type**)
- Use a **return statement** to indicate the specific value being returned to the caller.  

```cpp
return_type function_name()
{   
    // function body
    return return_expression;
}
```

When the return statement is executed: 

1. The **return expression** is evaluated to produce a value.
2. The value produced by the return expression is copied back to the caller. This copy is called the **return value** of the function.
3. The function exits, and control returns to the caller.

**Summary**

The **return expression** produces the value to be returned. The return value is a copy of that value.

## Return values: Code Demonstration
```{.cpp #lst-return-value lst-cap="Return value in a function"}
{{< include ./cpp/return_value.cpp >}}
```

## Revisiting `main()`

In C++, there are two special requirements for main():

- `main()` is required to return an `int`.
- Explicit function calls to `main()` are disallowed.

```{.cpp #lst-revisit-main lst-cap="This program will produce compile error!!!"}
void foo()
{
    main(); // Compile error: main not allowed to be called explicitly
}

void main() // Compile error: main not allowed to have non-int return type
{
    foo();
}
```

## Functions can only return a single value

- A value-returning function can only return a single value back to the caller each time it is called.
- There are various ways to work around the limitation of functions only being able to return a single value, which we’ll cover in future lessons.


## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

_Golden Rule_  
**Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY)

```{.cpp #lst-violate-DRY lst-cap="This program violates Don't Repeat Yourself and can be rewritten"}
{{< include ./cpp/repeat_yourself.cpp >}}

```

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

We can rewrite the above by define a function and reuse the function multiple times.
```{.cpp #lst-DRY lst-cap="Rewrite the above program to conform with DRY"}
{{< include ./cpp/dont_repeat_yourself.cpp >}}
```

# Void functions (non-value returning functions)

## Void return values

To tell the compiler that a function does not return a value, a return type of `void` is used.
```{.cpp #lst-return-void lst-cap="non-value returning functions return void"}
{{< include ./cpp/return_void.cpp >}}
```

## Void functions do not need a return statement

- A void function will automatically return to the caller at the end of the function. No return statement is required.
- A return statement (with no return value) can be used in a void function -- such a statement will cause the function to return to the caller at the point where the return statement is executed.
- Consequently, putting an empty return statement at the end of a void function is redundant.
```{.cpp #lst-void-return lst-cap="`return` in a void function will cause the function to return to the caller"}
{{< include ./cpp/void_return.cpp >}}
```
